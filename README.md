# Authentication Web Application

## Overview

This project is a **full-stack authentication web application** built using modern technologies such as **Django**, **JWT** for authentication, **Vite React TypeScript** for the frontend, and **Django Rest Framework (DRF)** for the backend. It also incorporates **TailwindCSS**, **ShadCN**, and **Redux** for efficient state management and UI styling.

## Features

- **JWT-based Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Django Rest Framework**: RESTful APIs to handle the backend logic and communication.
- **Vite + React + TypeScript**: Fast frontend development experience using Vite, React, and TypeScript.
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive and modern design.
- **ShadCN**: Component library for building accessible and reusable UI components.
- **Redux**: Centralized state management for predictable and scalable application state.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend:
- **React** (with **TypeScript**)
- **Vite**
- **TailwindCSS** for styling
- **ShadCN** for UI components
- **Redux** for state management

### Backend:
- **Django**
- **Django Rest Framework (DRF)**
- **JWT Authentication** for secure login

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: v16.x or later
- **Python**: 3.x
- **npm**: Latest version
- **Django**: Installed in a virtual environment

### Installation

#### Backend (Django + DRF)
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
3. Install the Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run migrations:
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
5. Create a `.env` file for environment variables and add your secret keys, database configuration, etc.

6. Run the backend server:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

#### Frontend (Vite React TypeScript)
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2. Install the frontend dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Create a `.env` file and add the necessary environment variables for API endpoints.

4. Start the Vite development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Usage

Once both servers (backend and frontend) are running, you can access the frontend at `http://localhost:5173` and the backend at `http://localhost:8000`.

- **Authentication Flow**: 
    - User signs up/signs in through the frontend.
    - JWT token is generated by the backend and stored in the frontend for future authenticated requests.
